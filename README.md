# NLP-resume-parser-using-spacy
Use the popular Spacy NLP python library for OCR and text classification to build a Resume Parser in python.

Imagine working as an intern in a company's Human Resource Department, and you have been provided with a massive pile of about 1000 resumes. Your task is to prepare a list of candidates suitable for the software engineer role. Now, since this company didn't provide the candidates with a resume format, it is your job to analyze each resume manually. How tiring, right? Well, there is an easy way out: building a Resume Parsing Application that takes resumes as input, then extracts and analyses all the valuable information from it. Companies' recruiters and HR teams have a tough time scanning thousands of qualified resumes. They either need many people to do this or miss out on qualified candidates. Spending too many labor hours segregating candidates' resume's manually is a waste of a company's time, money, and productivity. We thus suggest you work on this Resume Parsing project that can automate the segregation task and save companies a lot of time.
